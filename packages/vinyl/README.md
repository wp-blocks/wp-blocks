## What is this?

A simple audio player block for WordPress Gutenberg.

## When should I use this?

This is currently a work in progress. You shouldn't use it yet on a production site. Though if you are interested in this, please try it out and submit feedback and/or a pull request.

The goal of this block is to create a customizable audio player that builds on the functionality of the `core/audio` block.

## Goals

- [x] Replicate the functionality of `core/audio`.
- [ ] Provide transforms to and from `core/audio`.
- [ ] Accessible UI
- [ ] Customizable UI
- [ ] Playlists

## Inspiration

- Gutenberg [`core/audio`](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/56df71497a18a5adfd11005aead4501a449531c7/packages/block-library/src/audio) block from `@wordpress/block-library`
